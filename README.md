  # Data Preparation

 We enter the data into a postgreSQL database using the specified information. The information has been divided into several tables, which are connected to one another by sharing common fields. Access to helpful database insights and quick and simple data manipulation are made possible via queries. A degree of data integrity is also ensured by using a database because of the enforced data types in our tables. We may prevent inaccurate values and duplicate data by establishing constraints like primary and foreign keys, which increases our confidence in the accuracy of the data we use.

# Discussion & Insights

 ### 1.How many transactions were completed during each marketing campaign?
 
The campaign, named "Summer Sale," has garnered the highest number of transactions among the analyzed marketing campaigns.

with a total of 7 transactions.

## Insights:

The "Summer Sale" campaign appears to have resonated well with customers, resulting in a significant number of transactions.

It suggests that seasonal promotions like summer sales can be effective in driving customer engagement and sales.
    
The "New Collection Launch" campaign follows closely behind the Summer Sale campaign, with a total of 6 transactions.

Despite not having the highest transaction count, the "New Collection Launch" campaign still performed well, indicating customer interest in new product offerings.

Launching new collections can attract customers and encourage them to make purchases, contributing positively to overall sales.



### 2. Which product had the highest sales quantity?


The "Organic Cotton Sweater" has the highest sales quantity among the analyzed sustainable clothing products.

## Insights:

The high sales quantity of the Organic Cotton Sweater suggests that it is a popular item among customers.

This could be due to factors such as the material (organic cotton) being favored by environmentally conscious consumers, or the design and style of the sweater resonating 

well with the target audience.

Both "Bamboo Yoga Leggings" and "Recycled Denim Jeans" have the same sales quantity, following closely behind the Organic Cotton Sweater.

These products also have a relatively high sales quantity, indicating their popularity among customers.

The use of sustainable materials like bamboo and recycled denim may contribute to the appeal of these products to environmentally conscious consumers.

Additionally, factors such as comfort, fit, and style may also play a role in driving sales for these items.


### 3. What is the top-selling product category based on the total revenue generated?

The "Bottom" category has the highest revenue among the analyzed sustainable clothing categories.

## Insights:

The significant revenue from the "Bottom" category indicates that products such as pants, skirts, or shorts are performing well in terms of sales.

Bottoms are essential wardrobe items for most consumers, and sustainable options in this category seem to be particularly attractive to customers.

The "Outwear" category follows behind the Bottom category, with slightly lower revenue.

While the revenue from the "Outwear" category is lower compared to "Bottoms," it still signifies a considerable amount of sales.

Outwear items such as jackets, coats, and sweaters may be popular choices among customers seeking sustainable options for layering and outerwear.

### 4. What is the average revenue generated per day during the marketing campaigns?

The "Summer Sale" campaign has the highest average sales per day among the analyzed campaigns.

## Insights:

The high average daily revenue for the "Summer Sale" campaign suggests that it has been very effective in driving sales on a daily basis.

This indicates strong customer engagement and conversion rates during the campaign period, resulting in significant revenue generation.

The "New Collection Launch" campaign has a moderate average sales per day.

Although the average daily revenue for the "New Collection Launch" campaign is lower compared to the "Summer Sale," it still indicates a positive response from customers.

This suggests that the launch of new collections has contributed to consistent daily sales during the campaign period.


Analyzing the average sales per day provides insights into the daily revenue generation of each campaign, allowing businesses to understand the effectiveness of their 

marketing efforts on a day-to-day basis.

The "Summer Sale" campaign stands out as the most successful in terms of daily revenue generation, indicating its strong impact on driving sales during the campaign period.

The "New Collection Launch" campaign also performed well in maintaining consistent daily sales, reflecting customer interest in new product offerings.

The "Super Save" campaign, while still generating revenue, may require further analysis to understand why its daily sales are comparatively lower.
